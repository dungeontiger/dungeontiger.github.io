title: Canada Data Errors
---
A number of people have noted that data on this site for Canada is off for some days. After an investigation it
has been determined that the errors are in the original data on the John Hopkins site.  I see a number of 
open issues and open PRs trying to fix the data but no one is looking at the right now.

I will be endeavouring to address this problem soon.  Stay tuned.
