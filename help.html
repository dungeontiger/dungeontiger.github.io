      <h2 style="margin-top:10px;">(TEST) COVID-19 Charts by DungeonTiger Help</h2>
      <h5 style="margin-top:20px;">Navigation</h5>
      <p>The navigation bar at the top of the site is your primary means of getting around.</p>
      <img style="margin:20px;border:solid silver 1px" src='images/navbar.png'/>
<p><a href="index.html">Home</a> will take you to main page.  <b>World</b> will show you summarizes for all countries, while clicking on a
      country name will take you to that country's page.  The drop down contains all the countries for which there is
      data.  Again, selecting one will take you to that country.</p>
      <p>At the far right of the navigation bar, <a href="about.html">About</a> provides information about the site and the author,
      while <a href="help.html">Help</a> takes you to this page.</p>
      <img style="margin:20px;border:solid silver 1px" src="images/right_navbar.png">
      <h5>Charts</h5>
      <p>You can hover over a chart to see specific values for those data points.</p>
      <img style="margin:20px;border:solid silver 1px" src="images/hover.png">
      <p>At the bottom of each chart is information about when it was last updated and where the data came from.</p>
      <img style="margin:20px;border:solid silver 1px" src="images/date.png"/>
      <p>The charts are drawn with interactive JavaScript.  However, each page has a link to the static image version of
      the chart.  Clicking the link will open a new tab with that image.</p>
      <img style="margin:20px;border:solid silver 1px" src="images/viewImage.png">
      <p>Hovering over the chart also provides the <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a> chart toolbar.  If you don't know what that is I suggest you don't
      use it.  It is intended for advanced users.</p>
