        <h4>Why DungeonTiger?</h4>
        <p>
            I sometimes get this question.  Long ago when the internet started and people were creating new accounts all the time I got tired
            of creating random user names like 'gibson_66' or 'stephen_gibson_98' so I tried to think of a user name that would be so unique
            it would always be available.  I thought "I like dungeons" (Dungeons & Dragons) and "I like tigers", so "DungeonTiger" was born.
